NOTE: Only songs from the Liked playlist will be downloaded. Other playlists will still be created, but any songs not in Liked will be missing.

── SETUP (Termux on Android)

1. Download the python script file (Spotydroid.py)
2. Install Termux from Google Play or F-Droid
3. Copy and paste this command line into termux to install all required packages.

```bash
echo -e "\033[33m>>> You have 10 seconds to allow storage access.\033[0m" && sleep 3 && termux-setup-storage && sleep 13 && echo -e "\033[33m>>> Answer 'y' to all installation prompts.\033[0m" && pkg update -y && pkg upgrade -y && pkg install python python-pip ffmpeg -y && clear && echo -e "\033[32m>>> Starting Spotydroid.py in Downloads.\n\n>>> For next runs, use: python /storage/emulated/0/Download/Spotydroid.py\n\033[0m" && echo "" && cd /storage/emulated/0/Download && python Spotydroid.py
```

 ── SPOTIFY API CREDENTIALS

On first run, the script will ask and guide you through your Client ID and Secret, saving them to the data folder.

 ── USING THE SCRIPT

- Log in to your Spotify account when prompted.
- All liked songs are downloaded to /storage/emulated/0/Songs
- Playlists are exported as .m3u to /storage/emulated/0/Songs/Playlists
- After it finishes, rename the folder to refresh android file system. #Songs > Songs (/storage/emulated/0/)
- Import the .m3u playlist files to Samsung Music (recommended player)

 ── HOW IT WORKS
 
This script downloads your entire Spotify Liked Songs library and creates M3U playlists for your saved playlists, complete with metadata.

It uses Spotify Web API, ytdlp, YTMusic API, mutagen, LRCLIB, Musixmatch, Spotify Partner API, TOTP and spotipy

- You provide your Spotify API credentials (Client ID and Secret) on first run.
- The script authenticates with Spotify and exports all your Liked Songs and playlists as CSV files inside a ZIP archive.
- It scans local MP3s by ISRC to identify which tracks are missing or extra.
- For each missing song it searches YouTube Music (Best quality and no "videoclip audio") and downloads the best audio match as MP3 using ytdlp.
- It embeds ID3 metadata: title, artist, album year, cover, spotify view count and synced lyrics.
- It fetches the release date and real play count from Spotify Partner API using a live TOTP token and writes both into the lyrics tag.
- After downloading all songs, it generates M3U playlist files based on your Spotify playlists referencing the local MP3 files.
- Finally, it renames the output folder to force Samsung Music to reindex the tracks.

The script is designed for Termux on Android and maintains a persistent Spotify login cache, so subsequent runs only download new or changed tracks.
